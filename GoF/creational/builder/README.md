# Builder Pattern

## Overview
Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.

## Real-World Usage
An example of using the Builder pattern in a real-world project to construct event filters can be found here:
[event-filter.builder.ts](https://github.com/ross2p/ems-api/blob/main/src/modules/event/event-filter.builder.ts)
