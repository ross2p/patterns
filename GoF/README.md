# Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns

The Gang of Four design patterns are divided into three main categories:

- **Creational Patterns**: These design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- **Structural Patterns**: These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- **Behavioral Patterns**: These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
